            <h5>Motivation</h5>
            <p>Stan is motivated by a need to grow his new business to protect his interests.</p>
            <p>Stan is looking for ways to engage with other business owners in the area, to get mentorship and
                advertizing opportunities.</p>
            <p>Stan wants to sign up with the chamber of commerce and learn about news and events. He also wants to see
                who is already a member to see if he knows someone to reach out to.</p>
            <p>Stan needs an easy way to connect with the local chamber of commerce.</p>

            <p>Cynthia wants to find stable, local companies who want to grow so she can invest in them. She knows the
                area is full of good opportunities, but she doesn't know where to strat looking.</p>

                can do some research. She also wants to engage with the board of directors about possibly advertising
                her services.</p>
